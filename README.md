# Unity3D-Project-Testing

This is project for an intro into Unity3D game development.

I have omitted Imported Assets from the Unity Asset Store due to licensing agreements.

I have toyed with very basic animations and controllers as well as C# scripting.

The basic idea was to get a feel for a top-down game with collision detection using Unity's engine and for scripting controllers for the player and environmental assets. This also served to familiarize myself with the Unity software.
